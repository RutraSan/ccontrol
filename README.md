Simulate mouse events for windows using your hand and a camera.

## Usage
Run the program and start using it. Closing the window will stop the program.

You can set a finger for the cursor movement and a finger for LMB, in order to preform LMB make a motion with the selected finger so that the tip will go up and down.

If no hand is detected in the camera nothing will happen and you can use your mouse.


**Hand detection is implamented by MediaPipe**
